/*
 * frame_hub.h
 *
 * Frame distribution between producer and consumer threads.
 *
 * Design:
 *   - One producer (the source worker thread) publishes frames.
 *   - N consumers (the encoder thread today) each own a single
 *     slot mailbox.
 *   - Mailbox semantics are keep-newest: if a consumer has not
 *     taken the previous frame yet, the previous frame is
 *     dropped and replaced. A slow consumer therefore never
 *     builds a backlog and never stalls the producer. Live
 *     video always prefers the freshest frame over queued
 *     stale ones.
 *
 * Frame data is copied exactly once, from the capture buffer
 * into one pooled frame, and reference counted to all
 * subscribers.
